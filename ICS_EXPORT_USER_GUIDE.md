## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### ✅ Pro Tips
- **Export daily**: Export schedule each morning for best tracking
- **Share schedule**: Send `.ics` file to accountability partner
- **One calendar**: Use one calendar for work, one for personal (import to appropriate one)
- **Recurring**: If you have same schedule most days, export and reuse file

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- ICS file shows **planned** schedule, not completed activities
- Mark events complete in your **calendar app** OR in the **Atomic app** (both work!)
- File size is tiny (usually 2-5 KB)
- ICS format works everywhere - it's an international standard

### 🔄 What If I Want to Change Events?
**Option 1**: Edit in calendar app (simplest)
**Option 2**: Edit in Atomic app, re-export, re-import

### 🗑️ What If I Export Twice?
- Calendar apps handle this well
- Newer export updates older events
- No duplicates created
